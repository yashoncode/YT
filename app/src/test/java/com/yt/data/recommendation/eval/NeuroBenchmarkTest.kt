/**
 * Runs the offline pipeline benchmark and writes a metrics report to
 * app/build/reports/neuro-benchmark/report.txt so engine changes can be
 * compared number-to-number across commits, not argued on paper.
 *
 * Assertions here are FLOORS — loose enough to be stable, tight enough that a
 * regression in repetition control or interest coverage fails the build.
 * Tighten them as the roadmap lands improvements.
