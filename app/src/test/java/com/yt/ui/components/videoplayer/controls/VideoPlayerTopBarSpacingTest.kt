/**
 * The top row's icons are asked to sit on an even rhythm (#977).
 *
 * Uniform `Arrangement.spacedBy` is not enough on its own: the gap a viewer sees is the arrangement
 * plus whatever inset each child leaves around its own glyph, so a child that sizes itself
 * differently from its neighbours reads as a wider or narrower gap. The toggles in particular go
 * through a different Material component from the plain actions, and one of them takes a hand-built
 * long-press branch, so this measures the rendered boxes rather than trusting the arrangement.
 *
 * The window is a phone in landscape fullscreen, which is where the row was reported. It is sized
 * deliberately: the right-hand cluster is laid out unbounded while the left one carries the weight,
 * so in a window too narrow for every enabled action the left cluster is measured to nothing and
 * the last button is clipped rather than the row wrapping or overflowing. That is reachable in
 * portrait with several optional actions switched on, and is a separate problem from the spacing.
