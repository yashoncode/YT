/**
 * The speed the viewer chose has to reach the player *and* the state every time (#867).
 *
 * Releasing the player resets the state flow to its defaults, while the manager keeps the chosen
 * speed so it can be restored onto the next player. Restoring it silently left the state reading 1x
 * against a player genuinely running faster, which showed the wrong figure on the speed pill and
 * made the long-press boost compare against 1x — so holding stepped to a speed already in effect
 * and appeared to do nothing.
