/**
 * The Shorts and music profiles are fixed constants rather than user preferences, so nothing else
 * re-checks them: [com.yt.data.local.BufferDurationsTest] only covers the video path,
 * whose durations come from DataStore. These tests are what stops an edit to the constants from
 * reaching a device as the #788 class of failure — `setBufferDurationsMs` throws while the player is
 * being built, which surfaces as a crash on every launch rather than as degraded buffering.
