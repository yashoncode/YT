 * Buffer durations for Media3's `DefaultLoadControl`, already reconciled with each other.
 *
 * `setBufferDurationsMs` asserts `min >= playback`, `min >= rebuffer` and `max >= min`, and throws while the
 * player is built rather than falling back. The values are user-editable and are capped again per device heap
 * at read time, so a combination saved as valid can be invalid when it is used — that is how #788 and #876
 * became launch crashes that repeated on every start, the offending value living on in DataStore.
