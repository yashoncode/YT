 * uploads inside a sixty-day window — so [SubscriptionShortsLoader] runs dry after the recent reels,
 * and with watched reels hidden it runs dry sooner every session. This tier walks the channels
 * themselves instead, and only as far as the user actually swipes: nothing here is fetched to build
 * a queue, only to extend one.
 *
 * Channels are worked four at a time and drained round-robin, so a page reads like a subscription
 * feed rather than one channel's back catalogue. A channel's Shorts tab carries no upload dates at
 * all, so real date order is not available here — each tab's own newest-first order, interleaved, is
 * the closest honest approximation.
