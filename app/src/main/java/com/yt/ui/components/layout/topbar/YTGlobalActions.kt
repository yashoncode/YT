/**
 * App-shell destinations that must stay reachable from every root screen.
 *
 * Before this existed, `notifications` had a single entry point — the Home top bar — so turning
 * Home off in navigation settings orphaned the screen entirely. Root tabs 3 (Subscriptions) and 4
 * (Library) can never be hidden, so rendering these actions on every backless destination
 * guarantees reachability for any navigation configuration.
 *
 * [unreadNotifications] is the flow rather than the current value so that a new notification
 * invalidates only the badge that collects it, instead of the whole shell that provides it.
