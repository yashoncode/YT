/**
 * Decides what the player screen does each time the playing streams turn out to be expired
 * (a 403/410 on a URL that worked a moment ago): re-extract, re-extract and drop what the cache
 * holds for the video, or stop asking.
 *
 * Counting is delegated to [StreamExpiryRetryLimiter] — the same limiter the player's error handler
 * uses — keyed by video id, so a new video always starts from a fresh budget. A video that has run
 * out, or whose playback the player itself abandoned, is latched: further expiry events for it are
 * dropped rather than starting a load that will fail the same way.
