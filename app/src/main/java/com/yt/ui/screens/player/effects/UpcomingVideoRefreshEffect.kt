/**
 * A premiere does not flip to playable at its announced time, so after the countdown expires the
 * video info is re-fetched until the upstream metadata catches up.
 *
 * The poll is bound to STARTED: nothing consumes the refreshed metadata while the player is not on
 * screen, and a backgrounded premiere used to keep a 30 s network wakeup running for ten minutes.
 * [attempts] is hoisted above `repeatOnLifecycle` so the ceiling stays a total across the whole
 * premiere rather than resetting on every return to the foreground.
