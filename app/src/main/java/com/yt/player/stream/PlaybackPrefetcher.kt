 * [InnerTubeVideoStreamExtractor.extract] with the same arguments, so [InFlightRequestCoalescer]
 * makes that call join the request started here instead of opening a second client ladder. The
 * work simply began a few hundred milliseconds earlier — navigation, composition and the player
 * screen's own setup now overlap with the extraction rather than following it.
